# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has named owners covering all core personas (PM, PdM, Scrum Master, Developer, QA/Testing, Stakeholder Rep, UX Designer, Technical Architect).
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- Scrum Master: enables agile events, facilitates continuous improvement, unblocks teams.
- Developers: implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- QA/Testing: validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- Stakeholder Representative: channels stakeholder groups and sign-off.
- UX Designer: drive user experience and usability standards.
- Technical Architect: system design, technical decisions, risk mitigation.

## Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager (with all involved roles)
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register (risk owners can include Scrum Master, Tech Architect, PM, etc.)
- Retrospective notes and action items (roles own improvements)

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, relevant roles, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies, role assignments (including new personas).
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate, unblock, improve.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: full-team participation in review and capture learnings.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync: PM + PdM + Scrum Master
- Twice-weekly standups: delivery team (Scrum Master facilitation)
- Monthly stakeholder updates (Stakeholder Rep manages)
- Ad-hoc escalations: Tech Architect, Product Lead, Sponsor as needed

## How to use these docs
- Update project charter with all involved personas.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` for context in Copilot Spaces.
