# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks—assign risk owners to PM, Scrum Master, Technical Architect
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities to all team personas

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders, delivery team, Stakeholder Rep, Scrum Master, UX Designer, and Technical Architect
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (involve roles for feedback)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points, Scrum Master facilitates)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD, QA/UX Designer input)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (Technical Architect, Scrum Master, Stakeholder Rep help)
6. Create release plan and milestone map
