# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well (all personas invited — Scrum Master organizes)
- What could be improved (UX Designer, Tech Architect, Stakeholder Rep especially encouraged)
- Action items (owner by persona, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes (team size dependent)
- Anonymous idea board optional for candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Scrum Master facilitates, assigns follow-ups to relevant roles/personas

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog/issues with clear persona/timeline
- Review outstanding actions in weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Owner (persona):
- Due date:
- Success criteria:

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items (owned by PM, Scrum Master, Tech Architect, etc.)
- Celebrate improvements, iterate steadily
