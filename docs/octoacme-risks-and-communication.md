# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Simple table includes:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner (PM, Tech Architect, Scrum Master, Stakeholder Rep, etc.)
- Mitigation
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution, input from Technical Architect/Scrum Master
- Assess: estimate impact/likelihood, consulting all personas
- Mitigate: actions/contingencies, clear role follow-up
- Monitor: review weekly sync/update status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify groups/needs (engineering, sales, support)
- Regular updates (Stakeholder Rep leads)
- Single source of truth (project README or release doc)

## Communication Templates
Weekly Status Template (all personas can contribute):
- Progress this week:
- Next steps:
- Risks & blockers:
- Decisions needed:

Incident Communication:
- Triage summary (Scrum Master/Tech Architect input)
- Actions taken
- Timeline/Next update
- Post-incident blameless retrospective (Scrum Master facilitates)

## Escalation Paths
- Team-level (Scrum Master/PM) → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor
- Technical escalation: Tech Architect engages
- Stakeholder escalation: Stakeholder Rep notified
- Security incident: notify on-call per runbook
